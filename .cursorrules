# Helvety Monorepo Security Rules

## Supabase Export - NEVER COMMIT

- `supabase/supabase.json` contains a full database export (schema, RLS policies, grants, etc.)
- This file is gitignored. Never suggest or add `!supabase/supabase.json` to override the ignore.
- Never move the export outside `/supabase` or commit it to any repo.
- Use `supabase/getSupabase.sql` to generate fresh exports; keep the output in supabase.json locally only.
